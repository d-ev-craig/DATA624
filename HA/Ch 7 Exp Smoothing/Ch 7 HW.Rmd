7.1: Consider the pigs series â€” the number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria each month.

a. Use the ses() function in R to find the optimal values of $\alpha$ and $l_0$, and generate forecasts for the next four months

From using `ses()`, we can see that for a simple exponential smoothing model our $\alpha$ should be .2971 and our $l_0$ should be 77260.0561
```{r}
#h will tell our SES model how far into the future we want to model
fc <- ses(pigs, h =4)

fc$model

fc
```


b. Compute a 95% prediction interval for the first forecast using $\hat{y} \pm 1.96s$ where s is the standard deviation of the residuals. Compare your interval with he interval produced by R

The Prediction Interval using $\hat{y} \pm 1.96s$ is slightly smaller than the forecast's 95% Prediction Interval

```{r}
moe <- sd(residuals(fc))*1.96

#sd(fc$residuals)  this is equivalent to sd(residuals(fc))

High <- round((fc$mean[1]+moe),2)
Low <- round((fc$mean[1]-moe),2)

paste('Manually calculated 95% P.I. for 1995 Sep :',Low,'-',High)
paste('Forecast Calculated 95% P.I. for 1995 Sep :',round(fc$lower[5],2),'-',round(fc$upper[5],2))
paste("Difference in Bounds is",Low-round(fc$lower[5],2),"and",High-round(fc$upper[5],2))

```


7.2: Write your own function to implement simple exponential smoothing. The function should take arguments `y` (the time series), `alpha` (the smoothing paramter), and `level`(the initial level $l_0$). It should return the forecast of the next observation in the series. Does it give the same forecast as ses()?

|   It does. It took a while to figure it out, but the key was to remember the level passed to the hand-made function needed to be iterated over to update itself for the number of observations in the forecast you pass it (labeled as variable y in the function definition). The original issue was attempting to use the initial level as the level for the current observation. 


```{r}
handses <- function(y,alpha,level){
  
  curObs <- length(y)
  forecast <- y[curObs]
  
  for (i in 1:curObs) {
    level <- alpha*y[i] + (1-alpha)*(level)
    forecast <- level
  }
  
  return(forecast)
}


sesFC <- ses(pigs)

alpha <- sesFC$model$par[1]
level <- sesFC$model$par[2]
#alpha <- .2971
#level <- 77260.0561



handses(pigs,alpha,level)

ses(pigs)

knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\dcrai\\source\\repos\\DATA624\\HA\\Ch 7 Exp Smoothing\\SES Component Form.png")
```


7.3: Modify your function from the previous exercise to return the SSE rather than the forecast of the next observation. Then use the `optim()` function to find the optimal values of $\alpha$ and $l_0$. Do you get the same values as the `ses()` function?
```{r}
#Modified code for only returning SSE
handSSE <- function(y,alpha,level){
  
  curObs <- length(y)
  se<-numeric(curObs)
  
  for (i in 1:curObs) {
    se[i] <- (level - y[i])^2
    level <- alpha*y[i] + (1-alpha)*(level)
    #forecast <- level
  }
  SSE <- sum(se)
  return(SSE)
}

#alpha <- .2971
#level <- 77260.0561

sseHand <- handSSE(pigs,alpha,level)


fc<-ses(pigs)
pointForecasts <- fitted(fc)

sseFC <- sum((pigs - pointForecasts)^2)
paste("Hand SES SSE:", round(sseHand,2))
paste("     SES SSE:",round(sseFC,2))
paste("Difference in Hand SSE and SES SSE:", round(sseHand - sseFC,2))

```

```{r}
##Putting this in another function since optim() can't take anything but numeric inputs and pigs would break it
params <- c(.5,50000) #Setting incorrect initial parameters for optim to start with
optFunc <- function(params) {
  alpha <- params[1]
  l0 <- params[2]
  sse <- handSSE(pigs, alpha, l0)
  return(sse)
}

opt <- optim(params, optFunc)
paste("The optimal values for alpha and l_0, respectively, are:", round(opt$par[1],4),"and",round(opt$par[2],2))
paste("The values ses() provided for alpha and l_0, respectively, are:", round(sesFC$model$par[1],4),"and",round(sesFC$model$par[2],2))
```
I receive nearly the same values as the `ses()` function does.
